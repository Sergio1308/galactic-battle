Mastered and done:

* Possibilities of the development environment "Unity" and how to use it to create cross-platform games
* Basic constructs and methods of the C# language (including those that are most often used to create scripts)
* Creation of mathematical regularities of the trajectory of movement of objects using C#
* Debugging, testing, building project (Android & Windows)
* OOP principles

# Rules and game overview:

### Goal 
Pass the waves and earn as many points as possible. Points are awarded for killing enemies and obstacles (like asteroids). 

### Game mechanics
The game screen contains the player object (spaceship) and obstacles (asteroids and enemy spaceships) that move towards the player (from top to down of the playing area). 
Spawn of obstacles on the playing area is presented in the form of waves.

With each new wave, the number of asteroids increases, and the spawn rate decreases (it means that more obstacles will spawn).

So far, enemy spaceships are classified by color and they are no different from each other, but in the future, color will indicate the rank of the enemy. Each rank will have its own characteristics and properties: color, health, shooting mode (e.g. shooting with two bullets).

### Conditions to end the game

The player only has one life. If the player collides with an asteroid, an enemy spaceship or the player is shot by its bullet, the game will be over.
